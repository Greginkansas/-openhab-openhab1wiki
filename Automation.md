# Introduction
In order to make openHAB act intelligent you can use rules and scripts to enhance your environment with ease and comfort. 
 

## Rules

openHAB has a highly integrated, lightweight but yet powerful rule engine included. Rules are written in a java-like language. Rules can be triggered with different types of events, like changes of certain device status change, time or system events.

Apart from defining flexible logic openHAB rules provide a set of different actions which can be taken by the rule, like sending commands and updates to devices, sending tweets or e-mails and so on.

## Scripts

Scripts is a way to create reusable components for your rules. If you need to use the same code from time to time in different rules you can create a script and then reuse it in different parts of your logic.

## Events

## Actions
Actions are predefined Java methods that are automatically statically imported and can be used within scripts and rules to execute openHAB specific operations.
