## What you need

1. You will need to install Java if not already installed. 
1. `openhab-runtime-<version>.zip`. This is the server. It can be found [here](http://www.openhab.org/downloads.html) like everything else follwing (Addons, Designer, ...).
1. Any bindings you want to use e.g.  `knx-binding-<version>.jar` or `http-binding-<version>.jar`
1. OPTIONAL: You may want to download a tool to configure the items, sitemap and so on. If so, download `openhab-designer-<your platform>-<version>.zip`. This will give you syntax validation, content-assist and more on your configuration files.
1. Configure the bindings, items, sitemap(s) and optionally add rules, scripts, transformations and persistences.
