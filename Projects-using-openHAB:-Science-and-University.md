All students are facing the same problem while writing their Bachelor- or Masterthesis: they are lacking of time. openHAB helps them to focus on the really relevant parts of their work rather than "wasting" their time on implementing foundation/framework services.

### Connected Home Lab

TU Dortmund University - Communication Technology Institute

#### Abstract
For presentation and validation the Communication Technology Insitute realized the Connected Home Lab in 2013. Students can validate their project results in a appartement like environment. Futhermore proof-of-concept demonstrators show the results of research projects.

One major problem in the area of home automation and smart home is the number of different technologies, vendors and eco-systems. The usage of a middleware is necessary to provide uniform access to different ressources in a home network. 

openHAB offers a elaborated open source framework based on OSGI with commercially comparable UI and performance.

#### How did openHAB help

openHAB has commercially comparable UI and performance. This is why, we can focus on the communication technology and use the "higher layers" without modification.

#### Contribution

##### FritzDECT
We implemented the fritzbox-aha binding. By communicating with the daemon running on the fritbox, we can control and monitor the FritzDECT sockets.
##### Homematic with CUL
We implemented the Homematic binding with the CUL-USB-Stick. Instead of relying on the CCU (HM central station), OpenHAB can communicate directly over a USB 868 MHz transceiver with HM devices.

##### wMBus binding
Smart Home system will be integrated with Smart Grid applications in the future. Currently, smart meters with wMBus interface are rolled out in Germany. We implemented a wMBus binding, which communicates over a serial interface with a 868 MHz transceiver. With the correct serial number of the smart meter, the encrypted packets sent periodically (1 min - 10 min) can be received. This way, the energy consumption of the houshold can be monitored with OpenHAB.

### SML System project

Universidad CEU Cardenal Herrera

#### Abstract / Description / Dates

The SMLsystem is a modular house built basically using wood. It was designed to be an energy self-sufficient house, using passive strategies and water heating systems to reduce the amount of electrical power needed to operate the house.

The energy supply of the SMLsystem is divided into solar power generation and a domestic hot water (DHW) system. The photovoltaic solar system is responsible for generating electric power by using twenty-one solar panels. These panels are installed on the roof and at the east and west facades. The energy generated by this system is managed by a device to inject energy into the house, or in case there is an excess of power, to the grid or a battery system. The thermal power generation is performed using a solar panel that produces DHW for electric energy savings.

Details can be found in this open paper: http://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/6/9/4639/pdf

#### How did openHAB help

All the systems are connected to a central openHAB instance, which controls the full house.

### URC Lab

Stuttgart Media University

#### Abstract

The URC Lab is a showcase for state-of-the-art smart home technology, paired with a user experience that is tailored to the individual users.  We use the Universal Remote Console technology (URC, standardized as ISO/IEC 24752) as a framework for pluggable user interfaces.  Different users get different user interfaces, depending on their needs and preferences, and depending on their controller devices that they bring with them.  This is a requirement for the acceptance of smart home technologies in the context of Ambient Assisted Living (AAL). 

Note: The URC Lab is currently set up and will be fully functioning by end of 2014 approximately.
