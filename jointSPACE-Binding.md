# Introduction

The jointSpace Binding lets you control your Philips TV that is compatible with the [jointSPACE JSON API](http://jointspace.sourceforge.net/projectdata/documentation/jasonApi/index.html) over Ethernet. 

It allows you to: 
* Send Button commands
* Set and Read Volume/Mute
* Set and Get Colors of Ambilight "Pixels"
* Set and Read Source

# Prerequisites
## Compatibility and Activation jointSPACE API
1. The TV has to be compatible with the API. This should be possible for all models since 2011, but a list of models and firmwares can be found [here](http://jointspace.sourceforge.net/download.html) 
2. If the TV is compatible and the newest firmware is installed, the API has to be activated. Therefore, you have to input on the remote "5646877223" (which spells jointspace on the digits) while watching TV.
