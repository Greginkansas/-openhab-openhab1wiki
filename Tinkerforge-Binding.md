Documentation of the TinkerForge binding bundle

## Introduction

[TinkerForge](http://www.tinkerforge.com) is a system of open source hardware building blocks that 
allows you to combine sensor and actuator blocks by plug and play. You can create your individual 
hardware system by choosing the necessary building blocks for your project and combine it with other 
home automation products. There are many blocks available e.g for temperature, humidity or air pressure 
measurement as well as for I/O, LCDs and motor control. You will find a complete List of available 
blocks [here](http://www.tinkerforge.com/en/doc/Product_Overview.html).

This binding connects the [TinkerForge](http://tinkerforge.com) devices to the openHAB event bus. 
Sensor values from devices are made available to openHAB and actions on  devices can be triggered by 
openHAB.

For now only a subset of the TinkerForge devices and features are supported, but more devices and 
features will be added in the near future.

The following devices are supported for now:
- Servo Brick
- DC Brick
- Dual Relay Bricklet
- Humidity Bricklet
- Distance IR Bricklet
- Temperature Bricklet
- Barometer Bricklet (barometer and temperature device)
- Ambient Light Bricklet
- LCD 20Ã—4 Bricklet (LCD, backlight and 4 buttons)
- Industrial Quad Relay
- Bricklet Industrial Digital In 4
- Bricklet IO-16

The TinkerForge binding bundle is available as a separate (optional) download. For installation of 
the binding, please see Wiki page [[Bindings]].

## Upgrading from 1.3
- LCDBacklight now is a sub device of LCD20x4 Bricklet (items file has to be changed)
- LCD20x4Button now posts an update not a command anymore (rules has to be changed)
- IndustrialQuadRelay sub id numbering now starts from zero (items file has to be changed) 

## General Remarks
The binding supports the connection to several brickd instances.

The binding supports the TinkerForge auto reconnect feature. Furthermore even if the initial connect 
failed the binding will make retries to get connected to the brickd.

## Generic Item Binding Configuration

### Basic Configuration

In order to connect openHAB to TinkerForge devices you need to define all the brickd hosts and ports 
in the openhab.cfg file.

The following properties must be configured to define a brickd connection:

    tinkerforge:hosts="<IP address>[:port] ..."

The properties indicated by '<...>' need to be replaced with an actual value. Properties surrounded 
by square brackets are optional.

| <b>Property</b> | <b>Description</b> |
| --------------- | ------------------ |
| IP address | IP address of the brickd |
| port | The listening port of of the brickd (optional, default 4223) |

For connecting several brickds, use multiple &lt;IP address&gt; statements delimited by a space.

Devices which do not support callbacks will be polled with a configurable interval, the default
 is 60000 milliseconds. This value can be changed in openhab.cfg:
 
    tinkerforge.refresh=<value in milliseconds>


### Example Configurations

Example for a connection to a single brickd:

    tinkerforge:hosts=127.0.0.1

Example for several brickd connections using different ports:

    tinkerforge:hosts=127.0.0.1:4224 192.168.1.50 192.168.1.104

## Advanced Configuration

There are several configuration parameters to control the behavior of the devices. The available 
parameters depend on the device type.

### Overview
For most of the devices **no configuration** is needed in openhab.cfg, they can be used with reasonable 
defaults. The only exception is the IO16 Bricklet (see below).

If you want to get rid of _uid_ and _subid_ statements in the items or rule file, you can use openhab.cfg 
to get a _symbolic name_.

A configuration line for a TinkerForge Device looks like this in openhab.cfg:

    tinkerforge:<symbolic name>.<property>=<value>

The *symbolic name* string can be used in the items configuration as an alternative for the uid and subid values.

The following table lists the general available properties.

|<b>Property</b>|<b>Description</b>|<b>Device</b>|
|---------------|------------------|-------------|
|uid|TinkerForge uid of the device (use the Brick Viewer to get this value)|mandatory for all devices|
|type|the device type|mandatory for all devices|
|subid|  subid of the device, subid's are used if a brick/bricklet houses more then one device (e.g. the Dual Relay Bricklet)|mandatory for sub devices|

The following table shows the TinkerForge device, its device type, subid and if it is an actuator.

|<b>device</b>|<b>type name</b>|<b>subid(s)</b>|<b>Callback</b>|<b>actuator</b>|

### Callback and Threshold

The TinkerForge CallbackListeners - if available - are used to observe the sensor values of the 
devices. These listeners are configured to update sensor values at a given time period 
(callbackPeriod). The default configuration sets the **callbackPeriod** to 1 second. This value can 
be changed in openhab.cfg. For now this value must be changed for every single device. The values 
must be given in milliseconds.

The callbackPeriod controls the amount of traffic from the TF hardware to the binding.

In addition to the Callback a **threshold value** can be configured. This threshold means that even 
if the listener reports a changed value, the value is only send to the openHAB eventbus if: the 
difference between the last value and the current value is bigger than the threshold value. You can 
think of it as a kind of hysteresis, it dampens the oscillation of openHAB item values.

The threshold controls the amount of  traffic from the binding to the openHAB eventbus.

sitemap file entry (e.g tinkerforge.sitemap):

    Text item=AmbientLight 

#### LCD20x4 Bricklet

The LCD20x4 is a bit special as it acts as actuator which can receive text messages. To 
achieve this, you have to configure the device as String item.


Whatâ€™s the meaning of this magic string?

    sendCommand(TF_LCD, String::format("TFNUM<213>%4s"Barometer.state.format("%d")
                      ))

TFNUM is just a flag to signal the binding that some position information is passed. The first 
number is the line number, starting from 0. The second and third number are interpreted as the 
position in the line, starting from 0. 

The above example would write the current value of the barometer bricklet to line 3 starting from 
position 14, with a fixed width of 4 (this is because of %4s).

#### Servo Brick

For the Servo Brick you can configure the velocity, acceleration, servo voltage, pulse width min, 
pulse width max, period and the output voltage (must be equal for all servos). The device type is 
"servo". Available subid's are servo0 to servo6.

The current implementation is more or less for demo purposes. The servo can only be used as a switch 
item, to move the servo to the most left or most right position.

brick:

| property | descripition | values |
|----------|--------------|--------|
| uid | tinkerforge uid | get value from brickv |
| type | openHAB type name | brick_servo |

servo sub devices:

| property | descripition | values |
|----------|--------------|--------|
| uid | tinkerforge uid | same as brick |
| subid | openHAB subid of the device | servo0, servo1, servo2, servo3, servo4, servo5, servo6 |
| type | openHAB type name | servo |
| velocity | | default=30000 |
| acceleration | | default=30000 |
| servoVoltage | | |
| pulseWidthMin | | default=1000 |
| pulseWidthMax | | default=2000 |
| period | | default=19500 |
| outputVoltage | output voltage can only be set once (will be used for all servos) | default=5000 |

openhab.cfg:

    tinkerforge:servo0.uid=6Crt5W

## Item Binding Configuration

In order to bind an item to a device, you need to provide configuration settings. The easiest way 
to do so is to add binding information in your item file (in the folder '${openhab_home}/configurations/items'). 

The configuration of the TinkerForge binding item looks like this:

    tinkerforge="(uid=<id> [, subid=<id>] | name=<name>)"

The configuration is quite simple. You either have to set a value for the uid and optionally for the 
subid of the device, or - if the device is configured in openhab.cfg - the "symbolic name" of the device.

| Property | Description | 
| -------- | ----------- |
| uid      | TinkerForge uid of the device (Use the Brick Viewer to get this value) |
| subid    | optional subid of the device|
| name     | _symbolic name_ of the device. The name is only available if there is some configuration for the device in openhab.cfg. |

## Item Types
Supported item types are "Switch Item", "Number Item", "Contact Item" and "String Item".
