The build in "Say" action of the squeezebox binding does provide a lot of convinience to realize TTS with squeezebox; but also has some drawbacks. It will submit your text to google translate to generate an .mp3. It offers good voice quality, is platform independent and supports many languages.

However - there are some reasons to use local work around to generate your TTS. Internet might not be available, security concerns as well as the dependence on the Google API/Service may be reasons.

The workaround/example below has several limitations; but might be of help to find your own way to realize local TTS with sequeezebox.
