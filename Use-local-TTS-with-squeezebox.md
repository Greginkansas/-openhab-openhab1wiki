The build in "Say" action of the squeezebox binding does provide a lot of convinience to realize TTS. It offers good voice quality, is platform independent and supports many languages. 

However - there are some reasons to use local work around to generate your TTS: Internet might not be available, security concerns as well as the dependence on the Google API/Service ...

The workaround/example below has more limitations; but might be of help to find your own way to realize local TTS with sequeezebox if one of the reasons mentioned prevent you from using the build in service.
