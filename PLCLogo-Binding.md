## Introduction

This binding provides native support of Siemens Logo! PLC devices. Communication with Logo is done via Moka7 library.
Binding supports currently three types of items: `Contact` for digital inputs, `Switch` for digital outputs
and `Number` for analog inputs/outputs. Currently only two devices are supported: 0BA7 (Logo! 7) and 0BA8 (Logo! 8)
