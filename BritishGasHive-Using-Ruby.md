RUBY [https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/](Ruby)

BritishGasHive Gem [https://rubygems.org/gems/BritishGasHive](BritishGasHive Gem)

This looks simple but I created the Ruby Gem for this so you don't have to do the hard work, you could do it all in one script.

One you have Ruby installed you can get the example script from

[https://github.com/josephdouce/rubygem-BritishGasHive](Git Hub)

Create a Number item with a binding to call the Ruby script and use the output to update your Number item, obviously change the "OpenHABAlertMe.rb to whatever you called your script.
