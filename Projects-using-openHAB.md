openHAB is used in many different ways and areas of interest. In the remainder of this page you'll a list of projects (at least this known to use). This list will grow over time and should a good overview of what has been realised with openHAB.

Please help to complete this overview!

## Science / University

All students are facing the same problem while writing their Bachelor- or Masterthesis: they are lacking of time. openHAB helps them to focus on the really relevant parts of their work rather than "wasting" their time on implementing foundation/framework services.

### Connected Home Lab

TU Dortmund University - Communication Technology Institute

#### Abstract
For presentation and validation the Communication Technology Insitute realized the Connected Home Lab in 2013. Students can validate their project results in a appartement like environment. Futhermore proof-of-concept demonstrators show the results of research projects.

One major problem in the area of home automation and smart home is the number of different technologies, vendors and eco-systems. The usage of a middleware is necessary to provide uniform access to different ressources in a home network. 

OpenHAB offers a elaborated open source framework based on OSGI with commercially comparable UI and performance.

#### How did openHAB help

OpenHAB has commercially comparable UI and performance. This is why, we can focus on the communication technology and use the "higher layers" without modification.
#### Contribution
##### FritzDECT
We implemented the fritzbox-aha binding. By communicating with the daemon running on the fritbox, we can control and monitor the FritzDECT sockets.
##### Homematic with CUL
We implemented the Homematic binding with the CUL-USB-Stick. Instead of relying on the CCU (HM central station), OpenHAB can communicate directly over a USB 868 MHz transceiver with HM devices.
##### wMBus binding
Smart Home system will be integrated with Smart Grid applications in the future. Currently, smart meters with wMBus interface are rolled out in Germany. We implemented a wMBus binding, which communicates over a serial interface with a 868 MHz transceiver. With the correct serial number of the smart meter, the encrypted packets sent periodically (1 min - 10 min) can be received. This way, the energy consumption of the houshold can be monitored with OpenHAB.
