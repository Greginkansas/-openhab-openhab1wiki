## Updating the openHAB runtime 1.7 to 1.8

If you have a running openHAB runtime 1.7 installation, you can easily update it to version 1.8 by following these steps:
 1. Unzip the runtime 1.8 and all required addons to a new installation folder
 1. Replace the folder "configurations" by the version from your 1.7 installation
 1. Copy all other customizations you might have done to the new installation (e.g. additional images, sounds, etc.)

If you use the openHAB deb packages from the apt repository
 1. Add this line to your sources.list: "deb http://dl.bintray.com/openhab/apt-repo   stable    mainâ€œ
 1. Open a command-line  and execute: apt-get update && apt-get upgrade

**NOTE: The upgrade process may overwrite your start script, so any custom modifications added to the openHAB launch command may need to be re-customized.**  An example of this is the use of named serial port instances with the option `-Dgnu.io.rxtx.SerialPorts=/dev/ttyAMA0`.  A restart may also be required.
