# Documentation of the CometVisu Backend

**Note: This feature will only be available in openHAB 1.4!**
# Introduction

This adds a backend for the web based visualization CometVisu (http://www.cometvisu.org). The CometVisu is a highly customizable visualization, that runs in any browser. Despite the existing browser based UI´s in openHAB, the CometVisu does not read the sitemaps. The layout is defined with an XML-based configuration file.

This is just a short overview, more details will be added soon!

# Requirements
